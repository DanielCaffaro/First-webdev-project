Slash, whose real name is Saul Hudson, is a British-American musician, songwriter, and record producer. He was born on July 23, 1965, in Hampstead, London, England. He is best known as the lead guitarist of the rock band Guns N' Roses, which he co-founded with singer Axl Rose in 1985.

Slash's distinctive guitar style, which is heavily influenced by blues and hard rock, helped define the sound of Guns N' Roses, one of the most successful rock bands of the late 1980s and early 1990s. He played on all of the band's studio albums, including their debut album "Appetite for Destruction" (1987), which is one of the best-selling albums of all time.

After leaving Guns N' Roses in 1996, Slash pursued a successful solo career, and also played with other bands such as Velvet Revolver and Slash's Snakepit. He has collaborated with a wide range of artists from different genres, including Michael Jackson, Lenny Kravitz, and Rihanna.

Slash is widely regarded as one of the greatest guitarists of all time, and has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Guns N' Roses.
